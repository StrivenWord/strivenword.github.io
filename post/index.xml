      <title>Too Late I Recognized a Scam</title>

&lt;p&gt;I was successfully scammed this month. Although I tend to be good at losing my invested effort, this was easily the hardest money I ever lost. What I retain is the change in my methodology that I effected in the effort to implement these two fictitious freelance projects, one of which successfully made off with my funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with my return to two freelancing job websites, Guru and Upwork. I do not fault these companies for my misfortune, as they prominently and repeatedly have warned users against communicating with potential clients outside of the platforms. Shortly after reactivating my accounts on either website and updating my profile photo, biography, and portfolio, I was contacted for job offers to which I had applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up discussing contracts with two parties concurrently. One of them, replying to my Upwork application, had offered me a long-term data entry contract for a property management company from Texas. This was the scam that successfully manipulated me into giving them a substantial amount of money. The other scam, which reached me through Guru, claimed to be offering me a contract to edit medical documents for the Serbian pharmaceutical company AbelaPharm.
Both of the companies are quite real and legitimate. While the postings on Upwork and Guru had been fairly imprecise, the detail in the scripted interactions and materials subsequently presented to me was enough to fool me. The contact who had ostensibly reached me through Upwork told me that the Upwork listing was being temporarily closed in order to prevent too many applicants but that we would soon proceed on Upwork again, where I was to be paid through the normal Upwork payment processing. At this early point, I might have known what to ask in order to reveal the scam had I had any past familiarity with processing payments through Upwork, but this was my first time ever to receive a response to an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both scammers interviewed me extensively before telling me that I had been selected for the contract positions. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t believed that there had been any substantial competition; after all, there hadn&amp;rsquo;t been all that many bids reported on Upwork and Guru. Thinking that they were proceeding with the interviews to apply pressure on me as a bargaining tactic and also that they were vetting for basic quality, I proceeded with the text chat interview processes. Now I see that my assumptions were pretty close to the truth. They were counting on my psychological response to the challenge as a way to manipulate me into continuing to buy in to their narratives. They also wanted to make sure I was the kind of gullible person worth the risk and time of scamming. As they told me, I passed the interviews. I was exactly the kind of person they were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both situations involved the same kind of scam and the processes were very similar, differences in technique, communication style, and the rhythm of their responses have lead me to conclude that the two parties were separate entities. In both situation, the initial message through the freelancing website contained a link to a PDF document providing instructions for contacting people, ostensibly with the HR departments of these websites. In both cases, the initial contact was through Skype. The one that successfully scammed me continued using Skype throughout the entire process, while the one for the medical document editing gig moved to Google Hangouts. In both cases, I received contract documents through email, which I signed and returned.
Had I been paying proper attention, the scam would have been revealed to me through the fact that the email address was spoofed to appear to be coming from the website of the property management company. When I viewed the full header of this email in Microsoft Office, this mistake was clearly visible, as the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;X-SECURESERVER-ACCT&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; value explicitly indicated another, much more suspicious email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://strivenword.github.io/post-images/scammed/outlook-screenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot showing the drop-down menu in Microsoft Outlook for Mac where “View Source” can be selected too see the full header of an email&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email concerning the medical document gig was much harder to identify as illegitimate. It was not merely spoofed but was a straightforward email address at the domain //abelapharm.net//. Again, however, paying adequate attention would have revealed the scam at this stage too. For one thing, had I attempted to view //abelapharm.net// in my web browser, I would have seen a blank domain parking page from the Lithuanian web hosting company Hostinger. I had searched the web to correlate the existence and legitimacy of this Serbian pharmaceutical company AbelaPharm, but its canonical website is at //abelapharm.rs//. I have no excuse for noticing the discrepancy in the top level domains, especially considering that the contract document I received in the email from //abelapharm.net// had a prominent link to //abelapharm.rs//.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick was to make me buy in psychologically so that I would persist through the unsafe and unreasonable requests that the scammers were yet to make. After having signed the documents, both parties took steps to verify my commitment, making sure that I was promising to go forward with a long term working relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I somewhat stuck up for myself during this process, asserting especially to the phony AbelaPharm representative that I had other commitments and that I needed to monitor the amount of time required for the part time medical document editing project closely. This caused the interviewer to state that his company had to re-evaluate my candidacy. They must have decided that my sincerity made me an appropriate target despite my concern for my workload, but at every point in that conversation, whenever I exhibited any hesitancy in my willingness to commit wholeheartedly to the team or raised too many questions about the technical details regarding my employment and training schedule, the person on the other side of the Google Hangouts chat would pause for a notably long time before replying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scammer pretending to be from the Texas company had a head start compared to the scammer claiming to be from Serbia. The Texas scammer convinced me to deposit a fraudulent check into my personal bank account in order to pay for a company laptop that was to have been preset with all the appropriate data entry and tracking software. Having a dedicated company laptop sure sounded like a better proposition than installing various tracking spyware on my own computer. I had asked if they were going to send it in the mail, but the scammer wanted me to purchase it from a supposed special vendor. Upon inquiring further, I was told that the company had further contracted with a drop shipper who would deliver it to my door, but that I had to buy it myself before it could be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Texas scammer and the Serbia scammer required that I use the bank&amp;rsquo;s mobile app to deposit fraudulent checks. Both told me to print a check that was emailed to me and to use my mobile phone to complete a mobile deposit. The Texas scammer definitively steered me away from going to my bank in person to make the deposit without seeming to put her foot down too explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told to use the deposited funds to buy American Express prepaid gift cards to cover the amount of the laptop, which I was then to submit back to my contact by photographing them so that she could arrange the purchase and coordinate the delivery. This highly suspicious request was not the Texas scammer&amp;rsquo;s preferred method; there was an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zellepay.com/&#34;&gt;Zelle&lt;/a&gt; that she had initially wanted me to link to my bank account in order to facilitate the monetary transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was a good conversationalist and actor. She talked me through reasons why alternatives including Venmo wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work. Her skill in easygoing but persistently hurried communication as well as my commitment weighing on my mind caused me to trust her with the details. I did as she asked, traveling around my city to find the requested American Express cards, which I purchased with my debit card using the fraudulent funds that were temporarily available in my checking account. Throughout the process, she thanked me many times for my persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been invigorated by the complicated task of procuring the prepaid cards. There had been several problems that I had to solve in order to get them as fast as possible, and my effort reinforced my commitment. After fully complying with the scam to the point of transmitting the prepaid cards, I felt the cognitive dissonance that I had been repressing. I had previously mentioned to the Texas scammer that my bank might be suspicious of the check until it clears, and I began to realize that the check would probably never clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suspicions became overbearing for me when, having already taken the money, the scammer attempted to recruit me. I think she felt bad for me, because of my sincerity and persistence, and because I had mentioned that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough money in my bank account to cover the full price of the laptop. She asked me if I would be interested in coordinating similar deliveries for other clients in the near future. After a delay, she said that she had spoken with &amp;ldquo;the boss&amp;rdquo; about my potential involvement and that I would receive a bonus if I were to agree to assist.
I declined, reminding her that she had said I would be paid through Upwork. She replied with a hasty &amp;ldquo;Sure&amp;rdquo; and then made an excuse about &amp;ldquo;logistical delays&amp;rdquo; when I asked when the laptop would be delivered. I said that I no longer believed in our association. I thanked her for the adventure and ended our Skype conversation with, &amp;ldquo;at least now I know how to recognize a scam.&amp;rdquo; She blocked me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long conversation with the Serbia scammer was going on at the same time. He was just getting to the part where he was asking me to use my mobile app to deposit his check after explaining that I was supposed to buy a special MacBook Pro with it. I stopped replying to him on Google Hangouts and have ignored all subsequent contact attempts on Google Hangouts and on Skype.
Prior to these disconcerting experiences, I had put in significant effort into organizing my space, equipment, and process in the hopes of being able to make a sustainable income freelancing. I was still coming off the high of all the organizational effort that I had invested, as well as the motivational energy from having just been working enthusiastically on something that turned out to be a shameful failure. I let the momentum carry me through the next steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found the stash of savings bonds family members had given me as a child, realized that they had now matured, and determined that I could repair the damage to my financial status using this resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I performed the research that I should have done before complying with the Texas scammer and documented everything about the companies the scammers were pretending to be associated with, their means of communication, and everything else relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reported both scammers to the FBI. I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ic3.gov/&#34;&gt;IC3 form&lt;/a&gt; to file two separate complaints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I called my bank the next morning after having noticed that the fraudulent check had already bounced. I made an appointment to come in to deposit my savings bonds, telling all staff members along the way all about the situation as dispassionately as possible, for the sake of everyone&amp;rsquo;s knowledge and familiarity with this sort of money laundering situation. The director of security from the bank called the next day, and I was pleased to tell him that my overdrawn account had already been repaired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of this post is an exercise in asserting my own narrative, so that in the future I will be better at resisting the narratives that people want me to buy into. I believe that the practice of confession has the power to effect tremendous progress for both individuals and for communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had known better, but I foolishly avoided the proper exercise of all the available knowledge that would have prevented my loss. Instead of utilizing knowledge and caution, I relied on reckless self-assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, it is interesting how easy it is to mistake the confident exercise of wisdom for false self-assurance. The difference is attention. Real wisdom has its eyes open; false self-assurance closes its eyes so as not to be overwhelmed by the full situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the first and truest scam.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NextCloud Kontraŭ OneDrive</title>
      <link>https://strivenword.github.io/post/nextcloud-vs-onedrive/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://strivenword.github.io/post/nextcloud-vs-onedrive/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Verkistoj bezonas kompletan ilujon, aŭ ili neniam eskapos la bazaron de mallimigitaj ebloj. Tial programaroj ekzistas pri ĉiu problemo kaj detalo laŭ la fluo el imago al informaĵo al publikigo. Du retnuba programaroj por datuma gastigo estas la Dropbox kaj la OneDrive, sed eble pli bona solvaĵo je verkistinta estas tio, ke la malferma-programara NextCloud instaliĝos permane. Ĉi tiu estas malpli multekosta kaj malpli komplika de tio, oni uzas specialajn eblecojn de la Dropbox aŭ la OneDrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por multaj, simpleco estas la direktanta strategio, sed iam verkistoj alprenas dosier-sinkronajn kaj dosier-konservajn sistemojn. Ĉu neniu alia afero, sinkronaj programaroj kiel la Dropbox, la Onedrive, ktp faciligas por diversaj retapartoj aliro de oniaj dokumentoj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamen, la tago alvenos kiam la One Drive aŭ la Dropbox ne sufiĉas. Kiam oni volas havigi dosierojn kun oniaj kolegoj, kaj la plej simpleca motodo necesigas la uzon de longaj ligoj malgracie almetinta al mesaĝoj. Kiel alia problemoj de simpleco, la plej simpleca solvaĵo lasas malorganizantan komplikecon. Por iu, sufiĉe komplika verkist-projekto, kelka motodo kunordigi diversajn specojn de dosieroj kun oniaj teamanoj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por simpleco, estus plej ideala, se la sama sistemo povus plivastiĝi, por ke, tute la sama programaro kapablus farigi la dosieran sinkronaĵon kaj organizaĵon. Estas êc pli dezirinda, ke la sama programaro devus enteni la aŭtorajn komentariojn kaj skemojn. Post kiam, ambaŭ plurobla dosieroj kaj plurobla personoj koncerniĝas, integrita solvaĵo iĝas dezirinda. La problemo estas, ke la pli multampleskaj instaloj de Dropbox kaj OneDrive, kiuj estas senpaga en ilian elementaj uzaĵoj, ambău kostas multan monon kaj bezonas teĥnikan lertegecon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dropbox&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Dropbox programaro estis la unua dosier-sinkrona sistemo, ke fariĝas popularan. Ĝia facila savkopio kaj sinkrono kaŭzis tion, ke homoj alkutimiĝas havanta aŭtomate ilian dosierojn en multaj komputiloj kaj en la interreto. Tamen, aspiro trans ĉi tio utilo ĉiam estis malhavanta klareco. Hodiaŭ, la eblo por hierarĥio de dosier-sankioj kun multaj uzantoj kostas monon, kaj la programaraj eblecoj estas limigita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por speciala funckieco, la Dropbox ŝargas Usona $15 monate por adminstra panelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- administra panelo: $15 monate
- nievelanta administra roloj: $25 monate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;onedrive&#34;&gt;OneDrive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La OneDrive venas el Microsoft-korporacio, kaj estas antaŭinstalita en la Windows-sistemo, kiu estis populariganta ĝin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OneDrive donas nur 5 gigabajtojn senpage. Plua datum-konservo ekas al Usona $1.99 por 100 gigabajtoj, kaj sekve estas asocianta je abonoj de la Microsoft 365 programaraj akompanantaro. Tamen, speciala administraĵo neniam okazas je iu abona nivelo. Por tio, oni devas rigardi tion, ke la retnuba programaro nomita ShareSpace kaj asocianta servoj faciligas. Estas evidente, ke ĉi tio superŝarĝus la celojn de verkistoj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nextcloud&#34;&gt;NextCloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unu solvaĵo implicas ke oni aĉetas aparta retservilo pri la DigitalOcean. Ĉi tiu monate kostas proksimume Usona $5.50, surbaze de uzadon, kiu povas diversi depende de la nombre de okazaĵoj, ke oni instalis la retservilajn programarojn. La kosto de $5.50 venas al la mezkvanto je la monata finpagoj de la nuna aŭtoro, laŭ ses monatoj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certe instali la NextCloud estas inviti komplekseco, sed ĉi tiu enfokusigas ĝin laǔ onies persona laborfluo. Estas difinitaj instrukcioj pri ĉi tiu realigo, do tiuj, kiuj komprenas sian dosier-sistemojn povas havi la avantaĝojn de administraĵo kaj plurobla roloj per nur iom da plua komplekseco komparita de la Dropbox aŭ la OneDrive. Verkistoj eble estas homoj, kiuj profitus pro la ordo el regado de tio, kiun ili komprenas. Ĉi tio povas bildigi tiujn, kiuj scias Esperanton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La vera celo estas tio, oni komprenas la fontoj de la neevitebla komplekseco. La nuna aserto estas tio, ke la rego de unu fonto de komplekseco estas pli bona ol malgranda sciaro pri multaj. Kie ĉia graveco, kiel mona kosto kaj entendebleco, estas konsiderinta, la eblo de persona retnubo eble estas bona solvaĵo por verkistoj.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Price of Writing Right</title>
      <link>https://strivenword.github.io/post/writing-right/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 23:21:30 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://strivenword.github.io/post/writing-right/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://strivenword.github.io/post-images/writing-right/price-of-writing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a man counting pennies&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to write is immediately painful, because it brings to immediate focus one’s internal misery. It would seem that to be actually effective and efficient as a writer, one must first go through whatever may be necessary to heal from one’s conflictions. But even if one is psychologically and emotionally stable at the moment of composition, that moment of staring at the blank screen will inevitably be a moment of tension as a thousand potential distractions loudly peddle escape from the confrontation. And though the first belabored phrase may indeed be among the hardest to conceive and to commit, unfortunately the rest of the composition never flows directly out of that initial spark of ideation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing as the process of creating a textual work – the definition used here – must be distinguished from merely chatting or conversing with written language. People who are at once gifted and cursed with wordy minds may be able to ramble on in low value, often self-indulgent sentences that compose sometimes lengthy documents. When posted as casual self-expression, these spiels may or may not be harmful or helpful for the overly verbose Internet user and his or her followers and commenters; but such documents barely count as written works. They neither solve an information problem nor incorporate artistry beyond crude emotional appeals. Naturally, textual messages between two people or closed groups seldom aspire to be any kind of real writing, but even in emails or chat systems a daydreamy person may (to the probable annoyance of his correspondents) convince himself that he is a great writer possessing the persuasive power of easily laying out the truth of any given matter in detailed wordage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a person will one day be confronted with needing or sincerely wanting to write something deeper than the complaints or curiosities that are coming easily to his mind at the moment. When the self-proclaimed writer tries to begin the task, surface thoughts form a haze that engulfs the road to the writer’s more valuable thoughts about his true topic, colluding with distractions to destroy resolve and freeze progress to a glacial grind. Unable to produce a reasonable piece of coherent writing in a specific segment of time, he must accept the truth. Real writing requires masterful discipline, and he is not much of a writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no escape, no other way to become the author of a work that is either informative or inspiring and that serves some use in its context. This is because the horror of really writing is not the task of thinking up coherent sentences and stringing the words together. The horror lies in slogging meticulously through one’s true thoughts, in having to analyze one’s thoughts and fit them together before being able to move forward to repeat the process. The struggle persists even for technical writing; no matter how rigid the format or well defined the subject, one’s problems and head noise will rattle around with every attempt to define an idea. Writing with sincere artistic intent sometimes involves less surface distraction but is harder in the more important sense of requiring much deeper self-confrontation. Hardest of all is trying to force artistic intent when the subject or story is not really what one values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As broken paragraphs take form and ragged ideas start to link together, the emerging prospect of having expressed an idea in the best possible way becomes the incentive for enduring the humiliating inefficiency. Writing is the purest way of incarnating ideas, meaning codified in the most direct and objective way possible. The ability to consistently create works of text that convey meaningful ideas is even more valuable in this age of many easy words and little meaning, and few make the effort to attain this valuable skill. Those who do likely discover that meaning is its own reward, offering a place for all the chaotic thoughts and an empowering reason to push past distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
